# pointsets
Various modules to construct points in N-dimensional space:

* enumerate_space: methods to visit grid points in N-dimensional space
* pointsets: regularly spaced and pseudo-random points in N-dimensional space
* quasirandom: quasi-random points in Euclidean N-dimensional space, unit circle, disk, sphere or ball
* random_permutations: return an array of integers in a random order
